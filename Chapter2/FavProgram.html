                <p>My favorite program that I have done so far was called <i>Miles Per Gallon Calculator.</i></p>
                <p>This program asks the user about the last ten trips they have taken.</p>
                <p>This could be as simple as going to the gas station, or going across the whole country.</p>
                <p>The user has to input their starting gallons, ending gallons and how many miles they traveled.</p>
                <p>It then calculates the MPG for that trip and up to ten trips.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-7">
                <p>Here is an example of some of the code i wrote:</p>
                <pre><code>
                        for(int trip = 1; trip <  mpg.length; trip++) {
			
                            //ask user for how many gallons they began the trip with
                            System.out.println("How many gallons did you have at the beggining trip " + trip + "?");
                            startGalGas = scnr.nextDouble();
                            
                            //if they enter in a negative number, an error message will appear
                            while (startGalGas < 0) {
                                System.out.println("Number needs to be greater than 0, enter a positive number:");
                                startGalGas = scnr.nextDouble();
                            }
                            
                            //ask the user for how many gallons were left at end of trip
                            System.out.println("How many gallons did you have at the end of trip " + trip + "?");
                            endGalGas = scnr.nextDouble();
                            
                            //if they enter in a negative number, an error message will appear
                            while (endGalGas < 0) {
                                System.out.println("Number needs to be greater than 0, enter a positive number:");
                                endGalGas = scnr.nextDouble();
                            }
                            
                            //ask the user for how many miles they traveled for the one trip
                            System.out.println("How far did you travel for trip " + trip + " in miles?");
                            distTraveled = scnr.nextDouble();
                </code></pre>

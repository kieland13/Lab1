Lab 7 Question 2

What does the vue error message mean? What causes it, and how do you fix it?

One thing that can cause this error is if a vairable is misspelled but thats typically not the case.

What this error means, is Vue is trying to render the component and the component wants to use the property "total"
but cant find "total" anywhere.

To fix this we should do:
1. Double check all the variables within the page are consistent and when we call upon them, 
they are consistent there as well.
2. That property or method is on a different component, so double check your parenthesis and 
brackets to make sure everything 
is lined up correctly.
